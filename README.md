Forum-Topic-Watcher
===================

A program to watch topics for new posts

Please note, this program only currently works for TeamFortress.Tv and AutoItScript.com.

If you have a specific website you would like to use this with, please email me and I can see what I can do.

But simply put, you choose a topic you wan't to keep an eye on and when there is a new post in that topic it will alert you to it!

You can choose to alert you with a simple window or for the program to play a sound of your choosing.

You may also pick between an automatic refresh (Topic scan) of x amount of minutes or a manual update.



So, when you're ready to use it run the program (A nice creepy eye icon to go with it!)!

After which you can choose from the tray icon to "Show Topic Watcher.." and it will bring up the GUI!

By default the program is set to a manual refresh but if you wish to do the timer click "Options" again and select "Manual or automatic refresh.."

And then choose "Change Time Interval.." to select a time of your choosing.

Everything else should be self explanatory but if you have any problems please email me at Tf2Prophete@gmail.com
